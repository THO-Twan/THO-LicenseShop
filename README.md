# THO-LicenseShop
The THO-LicenseShop script allows players to purchase licenses (e.g., Weapon and Hunting licenses) from a ped in the game. This script integrates with the ESX Framework and leverages the esx_license resource to manage licenses. Players can purchase a license only if they don't already own it
