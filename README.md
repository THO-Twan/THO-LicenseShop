THO-LicenseShop Script for FiveM (ESX)

This is the first script I have ever made. 
I used chatgpt to do it and it actually works..it adds a license to the player in the database, and gives an item to the inventory.
You can do whatever you want with this script, you can use any ped, move them where ever you want, 
add more licenses. (by default you can just buy a weapon license and hunting license) 
You can config the database user_license name and the inventory name of your license in the server.lua file.
Again I used chatGPT i know nothing about coding or scripts i was just too cheap to buy a script and too dumb to figure out others so I made my own, with ai...

Might just be me but as of now until I maybe figure it out.. I need to restart this script after the server starts to get it to work..

ChatGPT wrote the rest..
